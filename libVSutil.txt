The distinction between a `lib` (library) and a `utils` (utilities) folder in a project can often be subtle, but it generally comes down to the scope and nature of the code they contain.

### `lib` (Library)
- **Purpose**: The `lib` directory is typically used for code that encapsulates more significant functionality or external dependencies. It often contains modules or components that could be reused across multiple parts of the application.
- **Examples**:
  - **Database interactions**: For instance, a file that sets up and exports a Prisma client instance.
  - **Authentication**: Functions or classes that handle user authentication, token generation, etc.
  - **External API integrations**: Modules that interact with third-party services.

### `utils` (Utilities)
- **Purpose**: The `utils` directory is usually for smaller, helper functions or utilities that assist in common tasks but are not substantial enough to be considered part of a larger library or module.
- **Examples**:
  - **Validation functions**: Functions that validate user input or data structures.
  - **Formatting helpers**: Functions that format dates, strings, numbers, etc.
  - **Utility functions**: General-purpose functions that are used in various parts of the codebase, such as debouncing, throttling, or deep-cloning objects.

### Example of Names

#### `lib` Examples:
1. **prisma.ts**: Sets up and exports the Prisma client.
2. **auth.ts**: Handles user authentication, token creation, and verification.
3. **apiClient.ts**: Contains functions for making API requests to external services.
4. **emailService.ts**: Functions for sending emails via an external email service.

#### `utils` Examples:
1. **validation.ts**: Contains validation functions for user inputs.
2. **formatters.ts**: Functions to format dates, strings, etc.
3. **helpers.ts**: General-purpose helper functions.
4. **debounce.ts**: A function to debounce a given function.

### Application to Your Project

Based on the current context, here's how you might categorize your existing code:

#### `lib`:
- **prisma.ts**: The file that sets up and exports the Prisma client.
- **auth.ts**: Functions for authenticating users and generating tokens.
- **jwt.ts**: Functions related to JWT token generation and verification.

#### `utils`:
- **validation.ts**: Contains validation functions like `validateUser`, `validateLogin`, and `validateOrganisation`.

### Example File Structure

```plaintext
src/
  lib/
    prisma.ts
    auth.ts
    jwt.ts
  utils/
    validation.ts
    formatters.ts
    helpers.ts
  api/
    auth/
      login/
        route.ts
      register/
        route.ts
    organisations/
      route.ts
```

This organization keeps your code modular and easy to manage, making it clear where different types of functionality should reside.
